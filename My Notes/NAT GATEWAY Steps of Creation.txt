######################### NAT GATEWAY STEPS OF CREATION #############################

1 - allocate elastic ip

2 - create nat gateway

3 - create private route tables and associate subnets

4 - How Reference a Terraform Module

5 - Use Terraform Module to Create the Nat Gateways

6 - Push Code to the GitHub Repository

 1 - Allocate elastic ip. this eip will be used for the nat-gateway in the public subnet az1 


 2 - Allocate elastic ip. this eip will be used for the nat-gateway in the public subnet az2


 3 - Create nat gateway in public subnet az1

	- To ensure proper ordering, it is recommended to add an explicit dependency


 4 - Create nat gateway in public subnet az2

	- To ensure proper ordering, it is recommended to add an explicit dependency
  
	  on the internet gateway for the vpc.


 5 -  Create private route table az1 and add route through nat gateway az1


 6 - Associate private app subnet az1 with private route table az1


 7 - Associate private data subnet az1 with private route table az1


 8 - Create private route table az2 and add route through nat gateway az2


 9 - Associate private app subnet az2 with private route table az2


10 - Associate private data subnet az2 with private route table az2
